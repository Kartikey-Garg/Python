# üó£Ô∏è Speech Generation and Vocalization Project

Welcome to the **Speech Generation and Vocalization Project**! This project combines the power of **AI-based text generation** and **browser-based speech synthesis** to create a seamless experience for generating and vocalizing speech. üéâ

## üìÇ Project Structure

This repository contains the following key files:

1. **`speech_generator.py`**:
   - A Python script that uses the **Ollama Llama 3.2 model** to generate speech-like text based on a given topic.
   - Saves the generated speech to a file (`generated_speech.txt`).

2. **`speech_vocalizer.html`**:
   - A web-based interface for vocalizing the speech text stored in `generated_speech.txt`.
   - Allows users to:
     - Load speech from the file.
     - Adjust **voice**, **pitch**, and **rate**.
     - Toggle between **light mode** and **dark mode** for a comfortable user experience.

3. **`generated_speech.txt`**:
   - A text file that stores the speech generated by `speech_generator.py`.
   - This file is read by `speech_vocalizer.html` for vocalization.

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. **Generating Speech**
   - Run the `speech_generator.py` script:
     ```bash
     python3 speech_generator.py
     ```
   - Enter a topic when prompted, and the script will generate a detailed speech-like explanation.
   - The generated speech will be saved to `generated_speech.txt`.

### 2. **Vocalizing Speech**
   - Serve the `speech_vocalizer.html` file using a local HTTP server:
     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server
     ```
   - Open the file in your browser:
     ```
     http://localhost:8000/speech_vocalizer.html
     ```
   - **Steps to Follow**:
     1. Click the **"Load Speech"** button to load the speech text from `generated_speech.txt`.
     2. Adjust the **voice**, **pitch**, and **rate** using the provided controls.
     3. Click **"Play Speech"** to vocalize the text.
     4. Use **"Pause Speech"** and **"Stop Speech"** buttons to control playback.
     5. Toggle between **light mode** and **dark mode** using the button at the top-right corner.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Python**:
   - Install Python 3.x to run the `speech_generator.py` script and serve the HTML file.
   - Install the `ollama` library for AI-based text generation:
     ```bash
     pip install ollama
     ```

2. **Browser**:
   - Use a modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge) that supports the **Web Speech API** for vocalization.
